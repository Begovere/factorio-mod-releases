# factorio-mod-releases
A repository that contains the .zip archives that can be used for manual installation of my modifications for the game Factorio. Old releases can be found in the /old-releases/ directory.

# Installation
I recommend to perform the installation automatically using the download function of the client. If you want a manual installation, please follow these instructions:

Download the "(modname)_(version).zip" file after replacing "(modname) with the name of the modification and "(version)" with the version number you want to use. The latest version is always available in the root directory of this repository, older versions are provided in "/old-releases/".

Place the zip archive you downloaded in the "mods" directory in your user data directory according to https://wiki.factorio.com/Application_directory#User_data_directory. The default values are:

Windows: %appdata%\Factorio

MacOSX: ~/Library/Application Support/factorio

Linux distributions: ~/.factorio

Once these steps have been followed, the mod should be activated the next time you start the game.
